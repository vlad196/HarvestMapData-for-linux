# HarvestMapData-for-linux
It is only necessary to change the path of the directory where the addons are located

Instruction:
1. Download and install HarwestMap-Data
2. Open "DownloadNewData.command" in the editor
3. In line 12, change the path "basedir=~/Documents/Elder\ Scrolls\ Online/live" to the path to the addons folder
(Most likely you should have it like this: basedir=~/Games/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/306130/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/Elder\ Scrolls\ Online/live)
